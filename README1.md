# LEAD-SCORE-CASE-STUDY
##Problem Statement
X Education, an online education company, aims to improve its lead conversion process by identifying 'Hot Leads,' those most likely to convert into paying customers. The current lead conversion rate is around 30%, and the company's goal is to achieve an 80% conversion rate.

##Objective
Build a lead scoring model to assign scores to potential leads, reflecting the likelihood of conversion. This model will help the sales team prioritize efforts and focus on communicating with the most promising leads.

##Approach
###Data Exploration:

Understand the dataset and lead-related features.
Analyze the distribution of lead conversion and relevant variables.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.
Convert categorical variables into a suitable format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Gain insights into patterns, correlations, and key features.
Feature Engineering:

Create or modify features to enhance model predictability.
Model Building:

Utilize logistic regression for predicting lead conversion probability.
Train the model on historical data using identified features.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Lead Scoring:

Assign lead scores based on model predictions.
Recommendations:

Provide actionable recommendations to improve the lead conversion process.
Usage Guidelines
Install necessary Python libraries and dependencies.
Follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter notebook or script.
Apply the lead scoring model to new leads for prioritized efforts.
Results
The lead scoring model assists the sales team in focusing efforts on leads with the highest conversion potential, aligning with the company's goal of an 80% conversion rate.
